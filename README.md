# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project! This project showcases my skills in SQL through the process of cleaning and preparing the Nashville Housing Dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked with the Nashville Housing Dataset, which contains information about housing properties in Nashville. The dataset may have contained inconsistencies, errors, and missing values, which required data cleaning techniques to ensure its reliability and usability for analysis.

## Data Cleaning Techniques Applied

To clean the dataset, I utilized various SQL queries to perform tasks such as:

- Removing duplicates: Ensuring each record is unique.
- Handling missing values: Filling in or removing missing values to avoid inconsistencies.
- Standardizing data formats: Ensuring consistency in data formats across columns.
- Correcting errors: Identifying and rectifying any erroneous data entries.
- Removing outliers: Eliminating data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.

## Files Included

- **Nashville Housing Dataset.csv:** This file contains the original dataset before any cleaning operations were applied.
- **Queries.sql:** This file includes SQL queries used to clean and prepare the dataset.
- **README.md:** You're currently reading it! This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for navigating the repository.

## Instructions

To explore the project:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Queries.sql` file using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any compatible SQL client.
3. Execute the SQL queries to clean and prepare the Nashville Housing Dataset.
4. Optionally, review the `Nashville Housing Dataset.csv` file to observe the changes made after cleaning operations.
